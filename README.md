Dreamcatcher iOS App

Hello! Welcome to the Dreamcatcher iOS Readme. 

This app was created at the 2016 Knighthacks hackathon hosted at the University of Central Florida. 

The idea behind Dreamcatcher is when a user wakes up and still remembers their dream, they will discribe it inside the app. This input is then parsed and a video of stiched together one-second clips is created to recreate the feel of a user's dream. 
Upon launch, the user is presented with all of their past dream videos to watch and a button to create a new dream video. 

The app connects to a node JS server and uses the libraries Alamofire, Player, Glyptodon, and Kingfisher. 

Alamofire - https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire <br />
Player - https://github.com/piemonte/Player <br />
Glyptodon - https://github.com/marketplacer/Glyptodon  <br />
Kingfisher - https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher
